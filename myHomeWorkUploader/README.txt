if your system is linux-like system or MACOS X then

first you should ensure that you have installed mongodb and configure the mongodb

and you should install the supervisor global

———————————————————————— What I Say—————————————————————————————————————

 ———I didn’t finish following function
1: Student can’t check if themselves uploaded homework(there is some error)
2: I didn’t divided the privilege between Teacher and Student (anyone can publish the homework and look all homework)
3: I didn’t implement get-password-back function
4: It only tested on Google Chrome
5: and maybe a lot more BUG

All I didn’t do this is because of the short time until deadline
Thanks for look it
